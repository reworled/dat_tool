The dat_tool tool

This is a very simple tool that reads a directory of png or jpg images, and
creates QPIC .dat files of them all in another directory.

This is provided as part of a Qt Safe Renderer demo. The SafePicture element
uses QPIC [QPicture] type files for reading. This tool demonstrates how to 
produce the required format images, and can be used either as a study, or as
a part of the build tools. The license is 100% open, and you can use this 
without attribution if you need to.
